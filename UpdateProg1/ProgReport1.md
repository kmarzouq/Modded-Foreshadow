Low Frequency runs will massively vary access times to the point where the second consecutve access will be signficantly longer than the first at times

Faster frequencies lead to a slightly more effective exploit

extracted 0xff values usually accompany double digit access times around 45

trying to output access times will notably reduces exploit efficacy
